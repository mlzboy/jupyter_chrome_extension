Last updated: August 31st 2020

Thanks for using Jupyter Notebook code snippet! Here we describe how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our websites, software and services (“Services”).

## Personal information stored

In order to create a unique account, Jupyter Notebook code snippet does require that all users enter their email address and create a password, or use Google Single-sign-on, which is stored on the site, and may collect additional information such as name of organization, and whether they are a business users, teacher or student, in order to assign the user to the correct user group. Documents may be uploaded to Jupyter Notebook code snippet by users in order to share them with other users for collaborative processing. Jupyter Notebook code snippet does not store these files once the sharing process is completed. Annotations made by users are stored on the site in order to display them to other users viewing a shared document, and to display them to the user if the same file is later re-opened.
Please note that users can choose whether to share this information with us, but certain features may not function without it. As a result, users may not be able to access certain features if required information has not been provided. We will not require a user to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the service to the user, and we use this personal data for no other purpose than providing the service to the user.

Users can annotate documents and provide comments to other users they share a document with. None of this information is shared with any third parties without the user’s consent. None of this information is used to display advertising. The Service does not display advertising whatsoever.

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:

- **Account –** We collect, and associate with your account, information you give us like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address. Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers.
- **Services –** When you use our Services, we store, process and transmit your files and information related to them (for example, the annotations you make ). If you give us access to your contacts, we’ll store those contacts on our servers only for you to use. This will make it easy for you to do things like sharing your stuff, and inviting others to use the Services.
- **Usage –**  We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services, to aid trouble-shooting and optimisation ofthe Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.

Access to your information is given only as discussed below, but we won’t give or sell it to advertisers or other third-parties.

- **Others working for Kami –** Kami uses certain trusted third party services to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. They are listed below.

- **Other users you share it with –** Our Services display information like your name and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. Certain features let you make additional information available to other users.

- You can also give third parties access to your information and account – for example, via Kami APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.

- **Law & Order –** We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Kami or our users; or (d) protect Kami’s property rights.

- **Stewardship of your data** is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our users’ data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it’s stored on our services or on their home computer’s hard drive. We’ll abide by our principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests for our users’ data:

  - Be transparent,
  - Fight blanket requests,
  - Protect all users, and
  - Provide trusted services.
